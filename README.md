# Vanilla NodeJS API

Simple NodeJS API without express, for learning purposes.

I have been building RESTful APIs in NodeJS with the help of Express and and other node packages for a while now.

I thought I would build a simple NodeJS API without any frameworks to get a better understanding of what goes on under the hood. 

## Running

Download, install packages with `npm i` and run with `npm run dev`.

The server should be running on your http://localhost:5000.

## The API

The following endpoins are implemented:

* GET /api/products
* GET /api/products/:id
* POST /api/products
* PATCH /api/products/:id
* DELETE /api/products/:id
